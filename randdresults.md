When you work at a certain level, new concepts and techniques often emerge, sometimes by serendipity, but more often through deliberate effort. These research results, when properly managed, formalized, and peer-reviewed, become small contributions that help move everything forward.

Over the years, I’ve had the privilege of creating **new technologies, methodologies, protocols, and algorithms** that have received international recognition through **peer-reviewed publications and conferences**. Here are some of the most notable:

### Cybersecurity Innovations

- **Wide-Scope CyberSOC**: A proposal to enhance outsourced CyberSOC capabilities, supporting holistic cybersecurity management across public sector organizations and their supply chains.
- **FLECO (Fast, Lightweight, and Efficient Cybersecurity Optimization)**: A multi-objective genetic algorithm framework for identifying cybersecurity solutions aligned with strategic goals. (2023)
- **CyberTOMP**: A systematic framework for holistic cybersecurity management at tactical-operational levels. (2022)

### Innovations on Opensource Governance

- **MeGAPOP**: A methodology for governing and assessing public open-source software projects, rooted in PMBoK and Prince2, adapted for the public sector. (2011)

### Network Engineering and Protocols

- **RI-CUBE**: A 3D structure for fast access and exploitation of traffic engineering data in interdomain MPLS environments. (2009)
- **PCE Discovery Subprotocols**: Extensions to OSPF-TE, ISIS-TE, and BGP for discovering PCE elements in inter-AS environments. (2008)
- **RABAN**: A routing algorithm for balanced active MPLS networks. (2004)
- **GPSRP**: A protocol for temporary storage and local retransmission of privileged packets in MPLS networks. (2004)
- **RLPRP**: A protocol for early activation of precomputed backup LSPs for privileged flows. (2004)
- **DMGP**: Dynamic memory for storing service-guaranteed PDUs in active LERs and LSRs. (2004)
- **TLDP**: A lightweight, connection-oriented subset of the LDP protocol with confirmed service. (2004)
- **EPCD**: An algorithm for early packet capture and discard in active LSR and LER buffers. (2004)

These contributions reflect a career-long commitment to applied research and innovation in cybersecurity and network engineering.
