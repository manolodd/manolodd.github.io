When I have time, when I feel the urge, or when my body asks for it, I write a post on this blog. No pressure, no stress. Sometimes I’ll write a couple of things in a week, and then go a whole year without posting anything. It’s simply my space to unwind—a place where I share thoughts I believe might interest someone else.
