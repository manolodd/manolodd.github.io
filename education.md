At this stage in life, I’m not sure it’s necessary to list every course and degree I’ve ever completed 🙂. I even question whether it’s still common or useful to do so in a 21st-century resume. So instead, I’ll simply mention the qualifications that most directly support my professional work today.

### Academic Background

- **Computer Engineer** — by profession and by passion.
  - Earned a **5-year degree in Computer Engineering** in 2004.
  - Later completed a **3-year Technical Engineering degree in Computer Systems** in 2006.
  - Both degrees were awarded by the **University of Extremadura, Spain**.

- **Researcher** — especially in applied research (I’m an engineer, not a scientist, though I deeply value their work).
  - In 2007, I obtained the **Diploma of Advanced Studies (DEA)**, which granted me official research proficiency.
  - After years of publishing and investigating, I earned a **PhD in Information Technologies** in 2024, specializing in **cybersecurity management**.

### Professional Certifications

- **Project Management Professional (PMP)** — certified by the **Project Management Institute (PMI)** in 2014.
  - Despite years of experience and training, this certification helped me correct bad habits and embrace a more holistic view of project management.

- **ITIL v4 Foundations** — certified by **Axelos Global Best Practice**.
  - This helped formalize and reinforce my understanding of service management, which I apply daily.

- **Dual Master’s Degree in Cybersecurity Management and Leadership** — completed in 2021–2022.
  - Offered by the **International Institute for Global Security Studies** and **Università Pegaso**.
  - Focused on the strategic and managerial aspects of cybersecurity.

### Ongoing Learning

- Over **5,000 hours** of training across **60+ courses**, both national and international.
- Topics range from:
  - **Technical skills**
  - **Team and project management**
  - **Business strategy and leadership**

But above all, I learn the most from the people I work with, especially when they come from complementary disciplines.
