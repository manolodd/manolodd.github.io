When I talk about projects, I don’t just think of tasks or deadlines. I think of *people*, of *teams* that combine their strengths and talents to create something meaningful.

To me, a project only holds real value because of the people who make it possible, the *synergies* that emerge during the process, the *shared learning*, and the *relationships* forged along the way.

Each project is a story, and I remember every one I’ve had the fortune to lead or be part of. I don’t recall them for their final outcomes, but for what I learned and how those experiences transformed me, improving how I work, collaborate, and ultimately, how I live.

I’ve worked on *technology projects*, *R&D initiatives*, *volunteer efforts*, and even *personal ventures*. I’ve taken on various roles: as a *director*, *evaluator*, or *technician*. I’ve approached them from different angles*client*, *provider*, or *project owner*. Whether public or private, funded or not, each one has been a valuable source of experience and a cornerstone of my professional and personal growth.

In fact, projects are more than career milestones, they’re *opportunities to learn, connect, and grow*. Most of my practical knowledge comes from these lived experiences and the challenges I’ve overcome alongside people I often still keep in touch with.

Because in the end, what I value most isn’t the project itself, but the *connections* it creates and the *legacy of learning* it leaves behind.

Although I couldn’t list them all here, I’ve decided to give them, every now and then, space on my blog to share my insights and reflections. Each project is a lesson, and I hope those who visit find something useful or inspiring in my stories.

And of course, I’m always eager for new challenges. Because I know that the more projects I take on, and the more people I meet, the richer this journey called my career will be.
