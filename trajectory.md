I don’t believe in success as mere recognition, but rather as the ability to generate a *positive, lasting, and tangible impact* through one’s contributions. That defines me quite well.

Being able to improve the world around me through the discipline I love most, *engineering*, is one of the most fulfilling experiences I’ve had. Whether that’s called success or not doesn’t really matter to me.

I’ve always enjoyed exploring anything that caught my attention (life is short, and we never know when it ends). Over time, I’ve narrowed my focus in exchange for deeper specialization, but I still jump into diverse projects whenever I get the chance.

### Professional Journey

- I began my stable career in the **private sector**, working as a **systems engineer** at **Sadiel** (now Ayesa), contributing to major public administration projects.
- Later, I joined the **University of Extremadura** as a **researcher**, focusing on **R&D in Telematics Engineering** and gaining valuable teaching experience.
- I then transitioned to the **public sector**, joining **CENATIC** to design and manage a **Project Management Office (PMO)**.
- When CENATIC merged into **Red.es**, I continued leading the PMO within a much larger public entity, eventually coordinating an **IT management area** and overseeing various projects and services.
- Today, I work at **Red.es** as **Head of Cybersecurity**, applying a holistic vision and collaborating with national and international organizations.

### Parallel Endeavors

To avoid stagnation in the slow-paced public sector, I obtained authorization from the Ministry of Finance to take on additional projects. I also participate as a **researcher** in the **GITACA group** at the University of Extremadura.

Over the years, I’ve:

- Founded the **College of Computer Engineers of Extremadura**
- Launched the **PMI Madrid Chapter Branch** for Extremadura and Castilla-La Mancha
- Served as an **R&D project evaluator**
- Published **articles and books**
- Worked as a **judicial IT expert**
- Participated in **conferences, volunteer work**, and **international collaborations** (e.g., CCN-CERT, ICANN, EU TLD ISAC, IETF, PMI, ISOC)

### Looking Ahead

I still have goals to pursue—like founding a company beyond freelance work. I’ve come close a couple of times, even buying infrastructure, but plans fell through. It’s something I intend to revisit.

Having already written a book, planted a tree, and had a daughter, I feel reasonably fulfilled and excited for what’s next.
