Publishing is one of the most fundamental ways to share knowledge in a formal and structured manner. Whenever I get the chance, I write about the work I'm involved in, hoping it might be useful or interesting to someone else. Below you'll find a list of my publications; some include a PDF version as well. I'm not entirely sure the list is complete.
