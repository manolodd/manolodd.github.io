Welcome to my space. I'm *Manuel Domínguez-Dorado* — engineer, computer scientist, and researcher.

For me, engineering is more than a discipline; it's a powerful tool to solve the challenges our society faces. My passion for computer science goes beyond the technical—it extends into the formal and professional aspects of the field: *Computer Engineering*.

As a researcher, my focus is clear: I apply knowledge to create practical solutions that directly impact today’s technological reality. While I deeply admire pure science, I firmly believe that *applied research* provides the most pragmatic and valuable answers to many of the challenges we face.

Throughout my career, I’ve led projects across the public, private, and academic sectors—nationally and internationally. I’ve founded organizations, directed teams, and consistently pursued one goal: *to use engineering to solve today’s problems and prepare tomorrow’s solutions*.

In an increasingly complex world, I know that *multidisciplinary collaboration* is key. I love working with people from different fields, cultures, and perspectives to orchestrate ideas and build commitment. I believe in *shared leadership*, where everyone contributes to success.

**Do we share the same vision?** If so, don’t wait. Let’s get in touch and start creating together!
