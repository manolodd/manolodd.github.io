## OpenSimMPLS Project Summary

**OpenSimMPLS** is a cross-platform, multi-language MPLS network simulator originally developed at the University of Extremadura in 2004. It is designed for both educational and research purposes, offering an intuitive interface to simulate MPLS and GoS (Guarantee of Service) mechanisms. The tool supports experimentation with new protocols and techniques, making it valuable for academic and professional use. Now hosted on GitHub, OpenSimMPLS has been adopted in over 130 countries and has contributed to numerous scientific publications and innovations in telecommunications.

## Role and Responsibilities

My role in the project includes being the original author, current lead maintainer, and principal developer. I am responsible for overseeing the project's development, ensuring its stability, and guiding its evolution to meet both educational and research needs.

## Technical Approach

OpenSimMPLS is a desktop application built in Java, following an event-driven programming model to simulate dynamic MPLS network behavior. It uses Maven for build automation and dependency management, and Swing for its graphical user interface. The layout system has evolved from AbsoluteLayout to MigLayout for improved flexibility. Logging is handled via SLF4J, and simulation data is visualized using JFreeChart. Unit testing is supported through JUnit 5, ensuring reliability and maintainability of the codebase.

## Results or Impact

OpenSimMPLS has become a cornerstone tool in both academia and industry. It has been used in over 130 countries by universities and companies for teaching, research, and network design. The simulator has supported numerous scientific publications, including conference papers, journal articles, and technical theses. It has contributed to educational innovation, particularly in the field of telecommunication engineering, and has been referenced in international research. The project has also inspired user-generated content such as tutorials, scenarios, and YouTube videos, further expanding its reach and utility. Its long-standing development and active community make it a reliable and evolving platform for MPLS and GoS experimentation.
