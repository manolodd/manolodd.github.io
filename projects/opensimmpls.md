## OpenSimMPLS Project Summary

**OpenSimMPLS** is a cross-platform, multi-language MPLS network simulator originally developed at the University of Extremadura in 2004. It is designed for both educational and research purposes, offering an intuitive interface to simulate MPLS and GoS (Guarantee of Service) mechanisms. The tool supports experimentation with new protocols and techniques, making it valuable for academic and professional use. Now hosted on GitHub, OpenSimMPLS has been adopted in over 130 countries and has contributed to numerous scientific publications and innovations in telecommunications.

## Role and Responsibilities

My role in the project includes being the original author, current lead maintainer, and principal developer. I am responsible for overseeing the project's development, ensuring its stability, and guiding its evolution to meet both educational and research needs.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language used to implement the simulator.
- **Maven**: Build automation and dependency management tool.
- **JFreeChart 1.5.5**: To generate charts and visualize simulation data.
- **SLF4J API 2.1.0-alpha1**: Facade for various logging frameworks.
- **SLF4J Simple 2.1.0-alpha1**: A simple implementation of SLF4J for basic logging needs.
- **MigLayout Swing 11.4.2**: Layout management in the Swing GUI.
- **MigLayout Core 11.4.2**: Core of the layout management subsystem.
- **AbsoluteLayout RELEASE230**: Previously used for GUI layout; currently being replaced by MigLayout for better flexibility and maintainability.
- **JUnit Jupiter Engine 5.8.2**: To ensure code reliability.

## Results or Impact

OpenSimMPLS has become a cornerstone tool in both academia and industry. It has been used in over 130 countries by universities and companies for teaching, research, and network design. The simulator has supported numerous scientific publications, including conference papers, journal articles, and technical theses. It has contributed to educational innovation, particularly in the field of telecommunication engineering, and has been referenced in international research. The project has also inspired user-generated content such as tutorials, scenarios, and YouTube videos, further expanding its reach and utility. Its long-standing development and active community make it a reliable and evolving platform for MPLS and GoS experimentation.
