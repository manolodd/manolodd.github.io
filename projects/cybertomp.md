## CyberTOMP Framework Project Summary

**CyberTOMP Framework** (Cybersecurity Tactical and Operational Management Process) is a comprehensive and systematic framework designed to manage **asset-focused cybersecurity** from the **tactical and operational levels** of an organization. It bridges the gap left by traditional high-level cybersecurity standards—such as ISO 27001 or NIST CSF, which often lack detailed procedures for lower organizational layers. CyberTOMP provides a **methodological and procedural foundation** that complements these strategic frameworks, enabling consistent and holistic cybersecurity management across departments. The framework introduces structured processes, standardized metrics, and a unified list of expected outcomes (ULEO) to quantitatively assess cybersecurity performance. It emphasizes **strategic alignment**, **holism**, and **unity of action**, empowering organizations to dynamically adapt to evolving cyber threats while maintaining a clear focus on protecting critical business assets and ensuring continuity of operations.

Although the **CyberTOMP framework** can be applied in private-sector environments, it is **especially designed and particularly useful for public organizations**, which often face strong **structural compartmentalization into silos**, a **high dependence on outsourced technical services**, and a **complex supply chain**. CyberTOMP addresses these challenges by incorporating **specific mechanisms** that facilitate coordination across functional areas, ensure holistic cybersecurity management, and integrate supply chain dependencies into tactical and operational decision-making. Furthermore, the project includes **software tools** that support both the **implementation and evaluation** of the framework, enabling organizations to operationalize cybersecurity processes efficiently and measure their effectiveness over time.

## Role and Responsibilities

My role in the project includes being the original author, current lead maintainer, and principal developer. I am responsible for overseeing the project's development, ensuring its stability, and guiding its evolution to meet both educational and research needs.

## Technical Approach

OpenSimMPLS is a desktop application developed in Java to ensure portability and ease of use in educational and lab environments. It follows an event-driven programming paradigm, enabling responsive and dynamic simulation of MPLS networks. The application integrates third-party libraries such as JFreeChart for data visualization and MigLayout for flexible GUI design, enhancing the analytical experience for users.

The source code is fully internationalized, allowing easy integration of multiple languages. By default, the interface is available in English and Spanish, with Spanish automatically activated when the software runs on a system configured in that language. The project uses Maven for standardized build automation and dependency management, simplifying setup and development workflows.

## Results or Impact

OpenSimMPLS has become a cornerstone tool in both academia and industry. It has been used in over 130 countries by universities and companies for teaching, research, and network design. The simulator has supported numerous scientific publications, including conference papers, journal articles, and technical theses. It has contributed to educational innovation, particularly in the field of telecommunication engineering, and has been referenced in international research. The project has also inspired user-generated content such as tutorials, scenarios, and YouTube videos, further expanding its reach and utility. Its long-standing development and active community make it a reliable and evolving platform for MPLS and GoS experimentation.
