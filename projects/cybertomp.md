## CyberTOMP Framework Project Summary

**CyberTOMP Framework** (Cybersecurity Tactical and Operational Management Process) is a comprehensive and systematic framework designed to manage **asset-focused cybersecurity** from the **tactical and operational levels** of an organization. It bridges the gap left by traditional high-level cybersecurity standards—such as ISO 27001 or NIST CSF, which often lack detailed procedures for lower organizational layers. CyberTOMP provides a **methodological and procedural foundation** that complements these strategic frameworks, enabling consistent and holistic cybersecurity management across departments. The framework introduces structured processes, standardized metrics, and a unified list of expected outcomes (ULEO) to quantitatively assess cybersecurity performance. It emphasizes **strategic alignment**, **holism**, and **unity of action**, empowering organizations to dynamically adapt to evolving cyber threats while maintaining a clear focus on protecting critical business assets and ensuring continuity of operations.

Although the **CyberTOMP framework** can be applied in private-sector environments, it is **especially designed and particularly useful for public organizations**, which often face strong **structural compartmentalization into silos**, a **high dependence on outsourced technical services**, and a **complex supply chain**. CyberTOMP addresses these challenges by incorporating **specific mechanisms** that facilitate coordination across functional areas, ensure holistic cybersecurity management, and integrate supply chain dependencies into tactical and operational decision-making. Furthermore, the project includes **software tools** that support both the **implementation and evaluation** of the framework, enabling organizations to operationalize cybersecurity processes efficiently and measure their effectiveness over time.

## Role and Responsibilities

My role in the project includes being the original author, current lead maintainer, and principal researcher. I am responsible for overseeing the project's development, ensuring its stability, and guiding its evolution to meet the highest cybersecurity standards based on solid foundations.

## Technical Approach

CyberTOMP is built upon the existing controls and principles defined in the most comprehensive and detailed versions of recognized **cybersecurity** standards, models, and initiatives—such as **MITRE ATT&CK®**, **CIS Critical Security Controls**, and the **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**, among others (as opposed to information security ones). Based on this foundation, and following a deep and systematic analysis of both the theoretical and practical cybersecurity needs of private and, especially, public entities, a methodological model has been developed—together with its corresponding processes, procedures, and tools—to enable a **holistic, bottom-up management** of organizational cybersecurity. Each stage of its development has been thoroughly researched, tested through pilot implementations and real organizational deployments, and subjected to rigorous scrutiny by the scientific community through **anonymous peer-reviewed publications**. This provides the model with proven guarantees of **real-world applicability** and **demonstrated practical effectiveness**.

## Results or Impact

OpenSimMPLS has become a cornerstone tool in both academia and industry. It has been used in over 130 countries by universities and companies for teaching, research, and network design. The simulator has supported numerous scientific publications, including conference papers, journal articles, and technical theses. It has contributed to educational innovation, particularly in the field of telecommunication engineering, and has been referenced in international research. The project has also inspired user-generated content such as tutorials, scenarios, and YouTube videos, further expanding its reach and utility. Its long-standing development and active community make it a reliable and evolving platform for MPLS and GoS experimentation.
